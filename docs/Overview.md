## **How does Ritchie work? → Through Formulas!**

In Ritchie's context, **a formula is a script** that can be executed automatically or interactively through a command line.

Adapting an existing script to Ritchie structure allows you to run it **locally** or through **Docker**, and to share it on a **Github** or **Gitlab** repository.
