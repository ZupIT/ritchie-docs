You have to set Ritchie's credentials to avoid informing data multiples times through the terminal.

To do so, just run the following command: 

```text
rit set credential
```

The terminal will return this message: 

```text
? Select your provider [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> kubeconfig
  ansible
  aws
  github
  gitlab
  jenkins
  Add a new
```

After you chose one of the available providers, Ritchie will ask you to fill the following fields: 

```text
? Select your provider github
? username: DennisRitchie
? email: dennis.ritchie@zup.com.br
? token: 
✔ Github credential saved!
```

{{% alert color="info" %}}

You can check out on [**formula's editable files**]({{< ref path="Formulas/Organize the formula folder" >}}) to see how to manipulate the credentials defined in the session as formula input parameters (inputs in the config.json file).

{{% /alert %}}
