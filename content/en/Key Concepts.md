## Formulas

**Formulas** are nothing more than **automations**. That is, they are codes called through command lines to perform some operation. 

## **Formulas execution**

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Formulas are executed after running command lines on the terminal.
{{% /alert %}}

Depending on the formula, the user might need to inform input parameters.  
  
Those input parameters can be informed in different ways:

* After running the command on the terminal \(via **prompt**\) 
* When typing the command on the terminal \(via **stdin** or **input flags**\) 
* During the execution of the formula \(if coded using **prompt**\)

## Command Tree

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Commands used in Ritchie are grouped according to a **tree**.   
  
It is important to know this concept in order to actually understand the structure of the product.
{{% /alert %}}

In the case of Ritchie, the **Cobra** \(a Golang library\) pattern was followed using the following logic of building core commands:

**`RIT + VERB + NOUN`**

To allow more options and freedom for users, it is also allowed to follow the pattern below in the construction of formula commands:

**`RIT + GROUP + VERB + NOUN`**

The app name is Ritchie, so we use the name **`rit`** to start our command tree.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The **rit** command is therefore our parent command, or **root**. It is not executable \(it means that it will not start any operations if you use it alone in the terminal\), but has been configured to return the **helper command**.

It is necessary to use executable sub-commands \(which are child commands, or branches, of the rit command\) in order to start any process.
{{% /alert %}}

The executable commands in Ritchie are the commands located at the last level of the tree.  
  
For example, in the image above: 

* The **`rit set context`** command is executable, as it is at the last level of the tree. 
* The **`rit kafka create`** command is not executable as there is an executable **topic** subcommand, at the last level of the tree.

This command tree concept is the **core** of Ritchie's structure.   


{{% alert color="info" %}}
All commands and sub-commands are mapped in a tree dynamically created according to the repositories the user added locally on his computer by using the **`rit add repo`** command.
{{% /alert %}}
