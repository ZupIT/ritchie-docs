## How does it work? 

To install the **latest version of Ritchie** for MacOS, you just have to execute the command below on your terminal according to the version you want to work with.

However, it is important to keep in mind **there are some requirements** before starting the installation on Windows.

### Requirements

If you wanna use efficiently Ritchie on MacOs, our recommendation is to have the following elements configured:

* the **make** command \([Using "make" on macOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1469994/using-make-on-os-x)\)
* *5sum** tools
