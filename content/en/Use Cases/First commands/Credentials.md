## Set **Credentials** 

It is possible to set credentials \(secrets\) on Ritchie to avoid informing datas multiplus times through the terminal.

The command that will allow it is **`$ rit set credential`**  
  
On the [**Single version**](https://docs.ritchiecli.io/getting-started/choosing-a-version#single-version), credentials are encrypted locally on the session, through the passphrase informed at the [**initialization step**](https://docs.ritchiecli.io/getting-started/initialization#single-version).

On the [**Team** **version**](https://docs.ritchiecli.io/getting-started/choosing-a-version#team-version), credentials are encrypted on the **Keycloak** session \(online\) through the **Vault** \(Hashicorp\).  


```text
➜   rit set credential
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
Profile to add credential:
  ▸ ME (for you)
     OTHER (for another user)
     ORG (for the organization)
```

Every user can set his own credentials,  
On the Team version, server admins can also set credentials for specific team users or for the whole team.

```text
➜  rit set credential
✔ ME (for you)
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
Provider:
 ▸ darwin
     email-org
     github
     gitlab
     jenkins
     kubeconfig
     aws
```

Once the user select the profile option, he needs to select with provider he wishes to add. This provider’s list is setted inside the server configuration file.

```text
➜  rit set credential
✔ ME (for you)
✔ github
Github username:  user
Github token:  *
```

Once the user select the provider, he need to inform the selected credential’s datas.

Check the [credentials configuration section](https://docs.ritchiecli.io/developer/server#credentials-configurations) to understand how to manipulate the credentials defined in the session as formula input parameters \(inputs in the config.json file\).
