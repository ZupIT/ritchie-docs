## Introduction

Available only on Team Version, the server is responsible to provide the information needed by the CLI so it can execute Ritchie's commands.

To make this happen, each team must have a configuration file to start their server when using Ritchie. That file is **file\_config.json**.

Besides the configuration file, the CLI also provides and collect information through the **ritchie-server repository.**

To get to know our server repository, access [**ritchie-server**](https://github.com/ZupIT/ritchie-server) on Github.

## Server configuration

The file\_config.json will contain the configuration and authorization part of the trees and commands, this involves the following fields:

* tenant / team
* keycloak
* cliVersionPath
* repositories
* oauth
* credentials

The _**tenant / team**_ field represents the name of the team that must be informed by the user when logging in with Ritchie in the Team version.

The _**keycloak**_ field refers to the client [**Keycloak**](https://www.keycloak.org/) settings used by the server to validate the token and manage the keycloak \(url, realm, clientId and clientSecret\).

The _**cliVersionPath**_ field informs the URL to the provider in order to identify the version of the CLI being used.

The _**repositories**_ field indicates the formula repositories accessible by the team \(with name, priority, treePath, urls\) that the CLI will use to download the tree.json that will be in the [**.rit folder** ]({{< ref "CLI.md" >}})

The _**oauth**_ field contains the URL that will be used to login with the team's SSO \(Single Sign On\) tool.

The _**credentials**_ field contains a list of credentials that can be used within the team's environment, which can be set by both users and server administrators \(for specific users, or for the entire team\) using the **`rit set credential`** command.

### Here is an example of a file\_config.json

```text
{
  "zup": {
    "keycloak": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080",
      "realm": "ritchie",
      "clientId": "user-login",
      "clientSecret": "user-login"
    },
    "cliVersionPath": {
      "provider": "s3",
      "url": "http://localhost:8882/s3-version-mock"
    },
    "repositories":
     [
       {
         "name": "commons",
         "priority": 0,
         "treePath": "/tree/tree.json",
         "remote" : "http://localhost:8882",
         "serverUrl" : "http://localhost:3000",
         "replaceRepoUrl" : "http://localhost:3000/formulas"
       },
       {
         "name": "zup",
         "priority": 1,
         "treePath": "/tree/tree-zup.json",
         "remote" : "http://localhost:8882",
         "serverUrl" : "http://localhost:3000",
         "replaceRepoUrl" : "http://localhost:3000/formulas"
       }
     ],

    "oauth" :{
      "url" : "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/ritchie",
      "clientId" : "oauth"
    },
    "credentials": {
      "github": [
        {
          "field": "username",
          "type": "text"
        },
        {
          "field": "token",
          "type": "password"
        }
      ],
      "gitlab": [
        {
          "field": "username",
          "type": "text"
        },
        {
          "field": "token",
          "type": "password"
        }
      ],
      "email-zup": [
        {
          "field": "email",
          "type": "text"
        },
        {
          "field": "token",
          "type": "password"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Server testing

For the Team version to work on the CLI, the team will need :

* a server
* a [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) account \(open source tool\)
* a [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) account \(open source tool\)

It is possible to test these settings **locally**, observing through Postman files \(available in the **/testdata** folder\) how the server endpoints are handled by the CLI to work.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
To realize this test you'll have to clone the [ritchie-server repository](https://github.com/ZupIT/ritchie-server) on your computer. <!-- Esse repo não existe mais -->
{{% /alert %}}

To start this test you need to run the repository **docker-compose** file : `$ docker-compose up`

```text
version: '3'

services:
  vault:
    image: vault:1.3.0
    ports:
      - "8200:8200"
    volumes:
      - ./resources/vault.hcl:/vault/config/vault.hcl
    environment:
      - VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=87e7784b-d598-44fe-8962-c7c345a11eed
      - VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8200
      - SKIP_SETCAP=true
      - disable_mlock=true

  keycloak:
    image: jboss/keycloak:7.0.0
    environment:
      DB_VENDOR: H2
      KEYCLOAK_IMPORT: /tmp/keycloak/ritchie.json
      KEYCLOAK_USER: admin
      KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./testdata/security/keycloak:/tmp/keycloak

  stubby4j:
    image: sandokandias/stubby4j-docker
    ports:
      - "8787:8787"
      - "8882:8882"
    environment:
      STUBBY_PORT: 8882
    volumes:
      - ./testdata/stubby4j/integrations.yml:/usr/local/stubby.yml
      - ./testdata/stubby4j/response.zip:/usr/local/response.zip
```

Then run the **run-local.sh file** : `$ sh run-local.sh`

```text
#!/bin/bash

./create-vault-approle.sh . http://0.0.0.0:8200

export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200
export VAULT_AUTHENTICATION=APPROLE
export VAULT_ROLE_ID=$(cat /tmp/vault/role-id.txt)
export VAULT_SECRET_ID=$(cat /tmp/vault/secret-id.txt)
export FILE_CONFIG="$(pwd)/server/resources/file_config_local.json"

go run server//server/main.go
```

These 2 files work together with the **file\_config-local.json** located in the **/server/resources folder** of the ritchie-server repository.

Once everything is up, it will be possible to execute the requests via Postman that the CLI sends to the server to get the information necessary for its operation.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
A **core command** is being developed to allow a team to be able to create the configuration files as soon as the realm in kubectl, to be able to generate a server already working with Ritchie in a simplified way.
{{% /alert %}}

## **Credentials Configurations**

The **`rit set credential`**command allows to save credentials in the session \(locally in the Single version, in the Vault in the Team version\) for the user to take advantage of this data without having to inform them again when executing their formulas.

To use these credentials as inputs to a formula, there is a keyword that needs to be entered in the formula's **config.json** file.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
This file is where the **input** **parameters** that will be requested from the user when he will execute the command in the terminal to process the formula are configured.

That keyword is **CREDENTIAL**.
{{% /alert %}}

To know how to use it, you need to have access to the `ritchie-server` repository, and observe how the credentials of each tool are registered in the `resources/file_config_local.json` file as explained above in this section.

For example, **Github credentials** are configured as follows:

```text
"credentials": {
    "github": [
        {
            "field": "username",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "field": "token",
            "type": "password"
        }
    ]
}
```

Therefore, to be able to use Github credentials as input to a formula's `config.json`, I would need to inform them as follows:

```text
"inputs": [
    {
        "name": "git_user",
        "type": "CREDENTIAL_GITHUB_USERNAME"
    },
    {
        "name": "git_token",
        "type": "CREDENTIAL_GITHUB_TOKEN"
    }
]
```

When the formula command will be executed, the Github credentials will be fetched directly in the session, and can be used in the formulas without the user informing them again at the terminal.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Remembering that the user must have logged in, and set the credentials \(**rit set credential**\) for this to work.
