## How to create?

### Step 1: Run the formula creation command

Run the following command to create a formula:

```text
rit create formula
```

Then, you'll have to inform those inputs before running the formula:

1. The **command** \(following the **pattern `rit + group + verb + noun`** to respect the [**tree pattern**](https://docs.ritchiecli.io/key-concepts#command-tree)\).
2. The formula's **programming language**. 
3. **The path** used to save formula's files. 

**Example:** `rit demo create formula`

### **Step 2: Test your formula** 

You can test the formula directly after its creation. That's possible because  the **`rit create formula`** command also builds the formula automatically \(it generates the formula's executable files and add them on **.rit folder**\).

In that case, the formula **"Hello World" template** will be executed as shown below:

![Exemplo demo de f&#xF3;rmula &quot;Hello-World&quot;](/rit_demo_hello-world_hd.gif)

This template is composed of 4 **inputs parameters**, that represents the currently available kinds of inputs to use Ritchie:

1. A **`sample text`** variable
2. A **`sample list`** of text variables
3. A **`sample boolean`** variable
4. A **`sample password`** variable

When you finished your formula creation, it will be built and sent to a specific repository according to the name of your workspace with the prefix **"local".** 

**Example:** if we have a workspace with the name `Default`.

```text
{
    "Default":"/home/user/ritchie-formula-local"
}
```

A repository associated to this workspace will be created on the `/home/user/.rit/repos` folder, and added on the `repositories.json` file.

```text
[
	{
		"provider": "Local",
		"name": "local-default",
		"version": "0.0.0",
		"url": "local repository",
		"priority": 0,
		"isLocal": true
	}
]
```

## Next steps 

On this section, you saw how to create a formula on Ritchie and test it. To keep configuring the formula: 

👉 Go to [**implement a formula**](how-to-implement-a-formula/) to understand how to edit the files Ritchie creates after formula creation. 

👉 Go to [**build a formula**](how-to-build-formulas) to see how to continue the tests on the formulas you create.
